<blockquote>
I feel so priviliged to pen down a feedback for one of my favourite teacher, Archana maam.
I am reminded of a saying 'The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains.The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires'.
Maam has been a great teacher for me, because she not only imparted knowledge but inspired me as well.
Best wishes!

Archana M'am is the symbol of Modern-day Guru. Learning becomes so easy when she is teaching. She has a unique and very friendly approach towards her students. Her method is such that she never lets the student feel loaded. No long hours of boring lectures, no bulks of homework. Trigonometry, Calculus, Geometry... You name any mathematical devil and she can teach you how to tame it! I can assure that if Maths is your problem, Archana M'am is your best solution!
